# GradleScalaSeed

This is a sample scala project that uses Gradle instead of SBT. To run the project execute `gradle run`. If you would like to add arguments, execute `gradle run -Dexec.args="arg1 arg2"`.


This project includes basic logging via slf4j. It also includes a repl if you would like to load your application onto the classpath and test it. Simply execute `./repl.sh`. 

Specs2 output can be a little wacky - for well formatted test output, run your tests with `./test.sh`.
